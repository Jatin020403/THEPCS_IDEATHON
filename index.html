          $%^@*(loosely translates to Hes) hated their life. Being a university
          student at the prestigious Intergalactic Institute of Greatness had
          its perks-guaranteed success for their first regeneration cycle and a
          permanent path for future ventures into amassing great
          fortunes-however, their patience was wearing thin today. Today, their
          sadistic, downright horrible excuse for a professor decided to assign
          an assignment worth 20 percent of their final grade-ultimately of
          paramount importance. The overall topic was simple and general enough-
          an essay on the downfall of a planet with no extant sentient species.
          Simple enough. The list of planets to be assigned was displayed on the
          Galactan-board, where Hes' eyes skimmed over until they stopped. You
          see, the planet of choice for this class depended greatly on pure
          luck, and when it came to that, Hes was just hopeless. When they
          picked up the galacto-signal from the assessment station, they had
          their antenna wiggle with despair as they scanned it over and over
          again. "Earth".
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Maybe if Hes stared at the word long enough, it would make it
          disappear? It did not work. Hes opted for another method. Perhaps
          banging their head repeatedly against the desk would will the task
          away. Alas, to no avail. It only left them with a throbbing headache
          and an angry red bump ordaining their forehead. There was only one
          solution remaining. To procrastinate. Deeming that to be a suitable
          alternative, Hes successfully evaded all responsibility for the task
          ahead of them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Two millennia passed by at the speed of light. How unfortunate indeed.
          Hes now had precisely 32 galactan-hours remaining until their essay
          was due. To put it lightly, they were royally screwed. You see, the
          knowledge on Earth was minimal, and Hes frankly did not have the time
          or energy to open and read a book from the tremendous
          <em>Intergalactic Library of Knowledge</em>. Hes decided it was time
          to put the notorious phrase to use, "fake it till you make it". They
          opened their <em>galactop a</em>nd began.

            similar planets in the Milky-way galaxy. Its inhabitants (pred</em

            to 0.7 standard microgalactometers in height. While other forms of
            Earthian life existed near the end of the planet, few ceased to
            exist ex</em
          ><em>cept for the aforementioned humans.</em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Perfect- Hes thought. The first paragraph was over, with only 1700
          more words to go. Brilliant. That was all Hes knew about Earth,
          everything they could remember from their elementary school education.
          With little time left to spare, Hes opened the Galactopedia on their
          Galactop, and while it wasn't the <em>most trusted source </em>to
          exist, they were sure they could get at least bits and pieces of
          information to aid them in writing. The rest...was a
          fill-in-the-blanks problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Galactopedia, Hes' only source of salvation at this
          point, the calamity that brought the end to civilisation on Earth,
          was..<em>.a nuclear bomb</em>? What on <em>earth</em> was that? After
          extensive searching on galactoogle, Hes found that it was an explosive
          device that released precisely 300 <em>galocalories</em> of energy.
          That barely covered one-third of Hes' hourly energy requirements. So
          clearly, this nuclear bomb thingy was simply breakfast- a small,
          non-filling breakfast. Interesting...<em
            >breakfast killed the human people</em
          >. A critical point to be noted indeed, Hes made sure to include this
          finding in his essay.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The human creatures also seemed to fight in recreations known as
          &lsquo;<em>wars'</em>. According to <em>Galactopedia</em>,
          <em>wars </em>were games held between divisions of the planet, known
          as <em>countries</em> and frequently occurred as a game of jest and
          sportsmanship. How very<em> peculiar</em>...Hes thought to themselves.
          As a matter of fact, Hes concluded that this nuclear bomb contraption
          was used in one of these game war events, effectively killing
          everyone. Earth was proving to be as finicky of a planet as he
          initially thought it would be...troublesome indeed. Clearly, low-level
          civilisations should stay away from activities, for they had such dire
          consequences- Hes decided.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, when Hes searched for the origin of the civilisation of the
          Aliens from Earth and their mannerisms, they encountered a roadblock.
          <em>There was simply no information to be found.</em> Yet, their
          professor had demanded that this segment exists in the essay-that was
          when Hes thought of an easy way out of this predicament: they would
          simply have to plot murder. Against their professor. For the next
          twelve <em>galactan-hours</em>, Hes extensively researched methods to
          kill and bury a body without raising suspicion. It was a productive
          time spent, indeed. Until it wasn't. Hes blinked up at the clock and
          felt their stomach drop. Only 5 <em>galactan-hours</em> remained until
          their essay was due, and they still hadn't found an effective way to
          discard their abhorrent professor or finish their essay. Hes proceeded
          to bang their head on his desk once more. This wasn't proving to be
          very effective. The time had come for Hes to charm their way out of
          this nonsense.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When Hes started getting back into it, they noticed something odd.
          Earth&rsquo;s last major extinction event though quick, had been
          building up for over a century. Something changed suddenly in the
          &ldquo;wars&rdquo;. As they called it, a significant change in climate
          was plaguing the planet's atmosphere. All the information on earth was
          extracted from their propaganda machines, which had all the data
          uploaded to the archives. There were rudimentary translations, but the
          interpretation was difficult, even for elite Alien relations and
          communications researchers. The roadblock they faced was discrepancies
          in the data presented and decisions taken. Hes scanned the data
          multiple times, hoping to find a galacto-nugget of truth. Then the
          realisation hit them like a cargo ship. They were overestimating the
          capability of these aliens.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hes took cognition boosters and worked on their assignment. The humans
          knew the anomalies in their ecology but pushed them aside and focussed
          more on their petty quarrels.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could&rsquo;ve stopped their extinction if only they had decided
          to take action, Hes couldn&rsquo;t comprehend the low level of
          critical and logical cognitive capabilities these primitives
          possessed. After the incomprehensible time that went into the
          gruelling task of researching and finally finishing the assignment,
          Hes was horrified to see that he had missed the deadline. Hes was
          ready to step out of the station and lose consciousness, drifting
          eternally in space. But they still wanted to present their discovery
          to the professor.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After Hes&rsquo; presentation to the professor in the Scientific
          conference ship, they expected proud feelings and encouraging remarks,
          but all they got was a laugh and a backhanded compliment.&rdquo; Only
          you could estimate the level of procrastination these aliens
          possessed,&rdquo; The professor communicated. &ldquo;You are still
          getting a Galacto-Backlog, though.&rdquo;

          <span
            >Zaid was scared and angry, primarily at the soldiers that changed
            his life for the worse in the last year. He could no longer count
            the number of birthdays he missed, a celebration that now seemed
            long forgotten. He could no longer count the number of times his
            father, a usually resolute, unrelenting man, cried in what he could
            only describe as despair- an emotion he had difficulty grappling
            with. His mother remained a shelter in the storm, reassuring him
            through this difficult time. Nonetheless, if he looked closely
            enough, he saw what resembled a flinch in her demeanour whenever
            soldiers passed by or a plane flew overhead.&nbsp;</span

        <p><br /></p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="">
          <span
            >He was beginning to find it increasingly tricky to understand their
            situation. When he got into fights with his friends, it resulted in
            hasty squabbles that led to cold shoulders or a slight reprimand
            from an adult. Despite his dad trying to explain their situation to
            him multiple times, all he was left with was a puzzling
            afterthought. A war was seemingly when whole countries fought among
            themselves- but he was left clueless by their methods and
            reasons.&nbsp;</span

        <p dir="ltr" style="">
          <span
            >His brother hadn&rsquo;t been home since before all of this
            started; he believed it was due to Hussein&rsquo;s admiration of
            President Saddam- his admiration for his brother grew when he
            thought of him fighting as a true patriot. When Zaid was just a kid,
            he remembered his brother playing soccer with a squishy ball, his
            nimble figure moving swiftly across the field. Although his brother
            was much older, he remembered running circles around Hussein, his
            annoyed face making Zaid happier than when his mother made
            Quzi.</span

        <p><br /></p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="">
          <span
            >The foreigners scared Zaid. They looked nothing like any people he
            knew. They reminded him of models on the posters of stores that sold
            expensive products. If these boogeymen could scare his mother, he
            trembled in fear, thinking how they could threaten him much more.
            Their desert pattern, funny hats and glasses too big on their faces
            startled Zaid- who found the look unexpected for boogiemen. The
            contrast made them even more unsettling. He wondered who those
            soldiers worked for. Did they have a fearless leader like Saddam,
            fighting side by side valiantly with his brother, or were they an
            aimless gang of bullies, similar but much scarier than the ones Zaid
            interacted with frequently?</span

        <p><br /></p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="">
          <span
            >The bullies were the worst. They were mean, rude and for no reason
            to boot. In fact, bullies disgusted Zaid more than anything else he
            could think of. Their bulkier, intimidating figures towered over
            Zaid, making him cower in fear and disgust. But the school bullies
            barely made an impact in front of the soldiers. Their terrorising
            presence no longer surfaced as the soldiers glared down at Zaid,
            their eyes boring into him. Zaid struggled to understand the sad
            look some of them seemed to have. Were monsters in the bedtime
            stories ever sad?</span
          >

        <p><br /></p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="">
          <span
            >Zaid saw other kids crying and clutching their parents. Were they
            not angry? They looked like they would not even dream of leaving
            their parents&apos; side. However, Zaid would like to give these
            strangers an earful if given a chance. His mom always stopped him,
            and surprisingly something in the back of his mind made him think
            listening to her was a good idea. He looked at school for
            companionship after his brother left. The school was his safe space
            despite the bullies. Though his parents were lovely, they were
            distant from him for a short while, even before they first had to
            leave the house. They had this gloomy mood hanging over constantly
            as if they knew what was coming. He missed most of the cartoons that
            week, his parents hogging the TV to watch &quot;news&quot;. The
            monotone speeches bored Zaid.&nbsp;</span

        <p><br /></p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="">
          <span
            >The highway generally meant a trip, and trips always made Zaid
            happy. But when they passed Highway 80 this time, he was speechless
            at its state. There was more traffic than he had ever experienced,
            but he had a feeling this traffic was never going to move. Most of
            the vehicles were in various stages of destruction. He could not be
            sure, but some glimpses of human forms were lying near the wreckage.
            His mom wrapped her arms around him and led him through, closing his
            eyes a few times.</span

        <p dir="ltr" style="">
          <span
            >Zaid hated waiting, and this was the worst he had ever endured. He
            was tired of waiting for the fighting to stop. He was tired of
            waiting for things to return to the way they were. But most
            importantly, he was tired of being kept out of the loop; all
            decisions were made by his parents in whispers and muffles. This
            ordeal was more brutal than the exams at school.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="">
          <span
            >He missed his friends. He missed a lot of things now that he
            thought about it. There was this now familiar gnawing at the back of
            his mind. He tried to ignore it and go to sleep. His mom would not
            be happy that he was lost in thoughts and is now past bedtime. He
            was about to drift to sleep when&hellip;.BOOM. He jolted
            awake&hellip;BOOM, it was closer this time&hellip;BOOM. His mom
            rushed towards him and hugged him tight, whispering in his ear how
            everything would be alright. But all Zaid had in his mind at that
            moment was a horrific realisation. He was ignoring and suppressing
            parts of his experiences. He remembered the soldiers shooting his
            neighbours, blood unable to stay within the lines of the body and
            splashing everywhere. He remembered his dad breaking the news of his
            brother&apos;s death. He remembered seeing his destroyed school. He
            remembered the collapse of their home amidst the chaos of pops akin
            to fireworks and flashing lights. He clutched his mom&apos;s sleeves
            and buried his face in her lap. Zaid wanted to curl up into a ball
            and turn off his senses. He felt weird; he felt something he
            hadn&apos;t felt in what seemed like a long time. His vision was
            blurry. He could not hold it in anymore. For the first time in a
            while, Zaid cried, cried as loud as he could. Tears rolled down his
            face in an unrelenting flow. His wailing was muffled and entirely
            smothered by the deafening explosions.</span

        <p><strong>Chapter 1:</strong></p>
        <p>
          They say retirement is the world&rsquo;s longest coffee break. Your
          <em><strong>Some</strong></em
          ><em><strong> day</strong></em> when you stop living at work and start
          working at living. But Pete &ldquo;Maverick&rdquo; Mitchelle
          didn&rsquo;t know that coffee was a euphemism for binge drinking. Not
          that he&rsquo;s kicking himself for it, the circumstances he was put
          through were such.&nbsp;But such was his state of mind that two
          bottles were not enough to extinguish his thoughts; so he remained,
          too drunk to fetch any more rum, not drunk enough to forget his past.
          He waved at the bartender to bill him and while he did that, he
          discerned the aesthetics of the place.&nbsp;It was a modest inn, with
          a wooden exterior, and two floors.&nbsp;Round tables and simple chairs
          made of rowan wood. log walls made of the same. Latex-stuffed pillows
          along the walls in case there aren&rsquo;t enough rooms at the tables
          to sit.&nbsp;He presumably picked this location since it was the only
          one in town which didn't make him feel out of place. But those
          aesthetics were the only things that he could relate to. The rest
          vastly differed from his day and time. Hybrid menus offer drinks in
          alcoholic and non-alcoholic variants, plant-based drinks for vegans,
          vapourised drinks that could be inhaled, and sex ratio is displayed in
          each and every tavern, giving him an ulterior motive for him to come
          here. After settling the score as he got up ready to leave, with
          earshot, he overheard two chavs ranting about how the world is full of
          warring nations and how nobody can settle their differences.
          &ldquo;Kids these days&hellip;..&rdquo; he thought to himself.
          nevertheless, these &ldquo;kids&rdquo; were around during his day, a
          century ago, as well.&nbsp;Now Tom usually hates confrontation, but
          this time he lets the drink speak for itself.&nbsp;Just before he
          prepares himself to leave, he turns towards them and interjects,
          &ldquo;It was much better to imagine men in some smoky room somewhere,
          made mad and cynical by privilege and power; plotting over the brandy.
          You had to cling to this sort of image because if you didn't then you
          might have to face the fact that bad things happened because ordinary
          people, the kind who brushed the dog and told their children bedtime
          stories, were capable of then going out and doing horrible things to
          other ordinary people. It was so much easier to blame it on Them. It
          was bleakly depressing to think that They were Us. If it was Them,
          then nothing was anyone's fault. But it wasn&rsquo;t them, was it?
          Always, it was us. A person often meets his destiny on the road he
          took to avoid it.&rdquo; And he left.

          Hyperloop or self-driving shuttle? He asked himself. On foot, replied
          each and every inch of his body. Given that no one is willing to walk
          anymore, he would have all the solitude he could ask
          for.&nbsp;Pete&rsquo;s&nbsp; 600-square-foot micro studio is located
