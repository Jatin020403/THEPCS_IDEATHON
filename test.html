    student at the prestigious Intergalactic Institute of Greatness had its
    perks-guaranteed success for their first regeneration cycle and a permanent
    path for future ventures into amassing great fortunes-however, their
    patience was wearing thin today. Today, their sadistic, downright horrible
    excuse for a professor decided to assign an assignment worth 20 percent of
    their final grade-ultimately of paramount importance. The overall topic was
    simple and general enough- an essay on the downfall of a planet with no
    extant sentient species. Simple enough. The list of planets to be assigned
    was displayed on the Galactan-board, where Hes' eyes skimmed over until they
    stopped. You see, the planet of choice for this class depended greatly on
    pure luck, and when it came to that, Hes was just hopeless. When they picked
    up the galacto-signal from the assessment station, they had their antenna
    wiggle with despair as they scanned it over and over again. "Earth".</span

    way to discard their abhorrent professor or finish their essay. Hes
    proceeded to bang their head on his desk once more. This wasn't proving to

    >When Hes started getting back into it, they noticed something odd.
    Earth&rsquo;s last major extinction event though quick, had been building up
    for over a century. Something changed suddenly in the &ldquo;wars&rdquo;. As
    they called it, a significant change in climate was plaguing the planet's
    atmosphere. All the information on earth was extracted from their propaganda
    machines, which had all the data uploaded to the archives. There were
    rudimentary translations, but the interpretation was difficult, even for
    elite Alien relations and communications researchers. The roadblock they
    faced was discrepancies in the data presented and decisions taken. Hes
    scanned the data multiple times, hoping to find a galacto-nugget of truth.
    Then the realisation hit them like a cargo ship. They were overestimating
    the capability of these aliens.</span
